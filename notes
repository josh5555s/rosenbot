create a game where you are given one feeling category and then you try to guess all the related feelings.
add the ability to get a hint.

convert feelings into objects that have attributes like:
- pleasentness -9 to 9
- energy -9 to 9
- emotion true/false
- belonging to general categories

add eytomologies to feelings, probably in seperate file
add the ability to request an eytomology at any time. #regex? (e 'feeling')

eventually create the django database that will track my use of all of the rosenbot games, high scores, etc.

using the database, allow user to pair feelings with met needs and unmet needs for future reference by rosenbot.

connects that activities needs spreadsheet for future reference by rosenbot.
